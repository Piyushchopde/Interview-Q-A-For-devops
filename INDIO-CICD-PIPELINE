we have java base application during creation of Cicd pipeline we decied to use jenkins sonarque and maven 

- First we Set Up AWS Resources Create an IAM user with programmatic access and provide necessary permissions 
       like AmazonS3FullAccess, AmazonEC2FullAccess, AWSLambda_FullAccess  
- After that Create an S3 bucket to store build artifacts , then Set up other AWS resources like EC2 instances,  Lambda functions as needed for your project.
-  can install Jenkins Server on Ec2 Instance from offical Website then Configure AWS Credentials in Jenkins
  In Jenkins, i went to  "Manage Jenkins" > "Manage Credentials" > "Global credentials" > "Enter the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key of the IAM user created".
- after that i Installed Required Jenkins Plugins: go to "Manage Jenkins" > "Manage Plugins" > "Available" tab 
         AWS Pipeline Plugin
         Pipeline Plugin
         Git Plugin
         Amazon EC2 Plugin
- aftet create pipelin for source code management for that we create new job in pipeline section choose "Pipeline script from SCM" and
        github and Enter the repository URL and credentials
 using sonarqub we if found any bug on code send email to user code has bug again user recorrect this code and send to
jenkins again sonarque check code quality and and send code to maven once all things are done maven build code and 
send development server after that QA engineer verity all the code after manager approval code send to production server write cicd pipeline  



- after that Create a Jenkinsfile in the root of project repository then Define stages for building, testing, and deploying your application using Groovy syntax
