 Instance-Group 
   - You can install group of instances using single entity called as Instance group 
   - 2 types managed instance group and unmanaged instance group 
        - manage instance group : support auto-scaling: 3 number of autoscaling mode present 1) on 2) off 3) only-scale-out , auto-healing loadbalaceing 
          manage instance group has 2 types : 
           - statefull and stateless
              statefull is use when you have database and dataprocessing related app with the help of that you can persist your data 
              stateless is use when you want to install and perform api related task
           there are many activity you can done during configuration of MIG like autoscaling auto healing , heltcheck , CPU utiliztion ,rooling update ,high avaiblity

Loadbalacer: loadbalancer used to distribute load 

GCP has 3 types of load balacer 1) HTTP & HTTPS loadbalancer 2) TCP loadbalancer 3) UDP loadbalacer
1) - support Internet-facing or internal ,Single- or multi-region
   - 3 types of loadbalancer present 1) Global external application load balancer: 
                                     2) Classic application load balancer
                                     3) Regional external Application Load Balancer
   - during creation of loadbalancer you need to create bankend,frondend and hostpath rule in HTTPS loadbalacer 
     in frondend you need to add port which port you want request 
     in backend you need to select Instance group 
     in hostpath if you have multiple path to send request then you can use it 

- ssl offloading means: when send request its send to https loadbalacer after its trafer to http in instance group that called as ssl off loading 
- ssl proxy is means : when usr send request to loadbalacer its convert as per requriment and send to host
- ssl passthorugh: when user send request is directly send to host without chnaging anything 
  
2) Internet-facing or internal , Single- or multi-region
3) Internet-facing or internal ,Single-region

GKE: standrad and autopilot mode

Google App Engine (GAE): simple way to deploy and scale your application in GCP
- its supports Go,JAVA,Node.js,PHP,python,Ruby 
- Automatic load balaceinga dn auto scaling 
- Application Versioning 
-Server less 

2 Types of APP Engine Enviroments: 
 standrad : Application run in langugage specific sandboxs
          - Complete isolation from OS/Disk/Other Apps
          - V1 : Jva,Python,PHP,Go (Old)
          - V2: Java,Python,PHP,Node.js,Ruby,GO (NEWER Version)
            new networks access and no restriction on languge extensions 
Flexible  : Application instance run within the docker conatiners 
         - Support Any runtime (with build in support for python, Java,Node,js,Go,Ruby,PHP)
         - provide access to background processes and local disk 


 App Engine scaling : 3 types of scaing instnaces in 1) Automatic 2) Basic 3) Manual  
      - Automatic Scaling instance base up on the load 
         - Autoscaling base up on: 
                    - Target CPU Utiliztion : Configure CPU Use Threshold  
                    - Throughput Utiliztion : 
                    - Max concurrent request :
         - Configure Max instances and Min Instances 
      - Basic : Instance are created as when request they are reveived :   
                -  Recommened to adhoc workload 
                - Instances are shutdown for zero workload 
                - not support by app engine flexible enviroment 
                - need to configure max instances and idle timeout 
      - Manual : Configure spefici number of instance to run 
                 adjust number of unstances manually over time   
 Application Components in App Engine : 
**  - Application: We can deploy One App engine per projects and in one APP engine we can deploy multiple microservices ** 
**  - If you want to create app engine in multiple region  then you need to create multipe projects **

Split traffice between multiple version :
   - we can split traffice using many ways :
        - IP Splitting : base on request IP address 
           - IP address can change causing accuray issuse 
        - Cookie splitting : cooki can controled from your application Cookie splitting accuretly assign your to version 
        - Random Splitting  

** dispatch.yaml file user to override routing rule 
** queue.yaml file used to managed task queue 
** app engine flexibal will not scale down to zero  app engine standard will scale down to zero 
** App Engine is region specific you cannot chnage there region once you deploy it

Storage: 

Block Storge: 
             - We can attached One Block storage to One VM in Write mode where we can attached multiple VM in read only mode 

             Types of Block Storge in GCP : 
              - Perisitent Disks: Networks Block Storge 
                  - More Durable 
                  - 3 Types: 
                         - Standard 
                         - Balanced
                         - SSD
              - Local SSDs:Local SSD are phycically attached with VM Instances
                    - Its used to hold temp data 
                    - Provide IOPS and low latency beacuse its attached directly to VM 
                    - Cupport SCSI and NVME interface 
File Storge : 
              -  File storge attached to multiple VM at same time
             Types of File   Storge in GCP : 


Encrptions: 
    Data States: 
      -  Data at Rest: Stored on a device or backup 
                    data on the harddisk  in a database , backup or archive 
      - Data in motion : being a trasforred across a networks 
                     Also called as Data in transit 
      - Data in use : Active data processed in a non-persistent state 
                      Data in RAM 

  For encrption we use below argorithm:
    -    Symmetric key encryption algorithm use the same key fo r encrption and decryption  
    -     asymmetric key encrption algoritham has two key public key and private key 
          - also called as public key crptiography 
          - encrpty data with public key and decrpt data with private key 
Cloud KMS:
       - Cloud KMS is use to craete and maganed crptograpic key 
       - Control their used in your application keys and GCP service 
       - use exsiting cryptoghay key created on on-premises 
       - keys types : 
           - Google-managed key : No COnfiguration requried 
           - Cutomer-managed key: Use ey from KMS 
           - Cutomer-suppied key : Provide your own key
