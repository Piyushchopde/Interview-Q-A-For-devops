   - during creation of loadbalancer you need to create bankend,frondend and hostpath rule in HTTPS loadbalacer 
     in frondend you need to add port which port you want request 
     in backend you need to select Instance group 
     in hostpath if you have multiple path to send request then you can use it 

- ssl offloading means: when send request its send to https loadbalacer after its trafer to http in instance group that called as ssl off loading 
- ssl proxy is means : when usr send request to loadbalacer its convert as per requriment and send to host
- ssl passthorugh: when user send request is directly send to host without chnaging anything
